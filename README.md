## Sidechain - Feedback for Music Producers and Artist

Sidehcain is a web app focused on providing music producers with a platform for recieving feedback on their music, while also returning the favor for their fellow producers. It's difficult for music producers to get feedback on their music through online means, as most music streaming website do not encourage giving feedback. With a lack of options for gaining feedback, producers and artists can't really gauge the quality of their final mixes until release. Sidechain aims to eliminate this issue by having its core functionality be centered around giving and providing feedback, creating a positive engagement cycle for its users

## How it works

User's can upload two songs to start out. once those songs have been uploaded, they can only post songs after gaining points, which can be achieved by providing feedback or recieving interaction on your comment (like, reply). This encourages users to listen to other tracks and provide meaningful feedback for their fellow producer's music.

## Additional Features

* User's have access to their personal profile page, which display's their uploaded songs, reposts, and likes. User's can customize the banner image and other stylistic aspects of the page
